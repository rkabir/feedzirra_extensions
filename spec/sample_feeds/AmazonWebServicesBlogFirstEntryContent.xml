  Late last year an entrepreneur from Turkey visited me at Amazon HQ in Seattle.

  We talked about his plans to use AWS as part of his new social video
  portal startup. I won't spill any beans before he's ready to talk
  about it himself, but I will say that he has a really good concept,
  strong backers, and infectious enthusiasm for the online world.</p>
</p>

<p>
  He's now ready to hire a software architect and designer in order to
  bring his vision to life. I've posted the job below; you can 
  send your resume to <a href="mailto:apply@web.tv">apply@web.tv</a>
  if you are interested, qualified, and located in the right part
  of the world.
